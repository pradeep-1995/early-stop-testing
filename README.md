# early-stop-testing

Early stopping is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks.
It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set as training progresses, and stopping training once validation performance stops improving.

The goal is to stop training just before the model begins to overfit to the training data. By stopping early, you avoid capturing noise in the training data and instead retain the model's ability to generalize to new examples.

To implement early stopping, you typically calculate the validation loss/error after each training epoch. If validation performance doesn't improve for a set number of epochs (the patience), training is stopped.

The patience hyperparameter determines how many epochs to wait before stopping. Higher patience means you're more tolerant of fluctuations in validation performance and less likely to overfit.

Early stopping works best when there is a clear distinction between training and validation performance curves. If the curves are flat or validation doesn't improve much, it may not be effective.

Compared to other regularization techniques, early stopping is simple to implement but still helps reduce overfitting. It allows you to train larger models than you otherwise could.

### Import the EarlyStopping callback from Keras:


from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
### Define the EarlyStopping callback:


early_stop = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss', 
    min_delta=0,
    patience=3,
    verbose=1,
    mode='auto'
)

monitor: The quantity to monitor, such as 'val_loss' or 'val_accuracy'.
min_delta: Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an improvement.
patience: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.
verbose: Verbosity mode.

mode: One of {auto, min, max}. In 'min' mode, training will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in 'max' mode it will stop when the quantity has stopped increasing.
### Add the callback to your model fit:

model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
          validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
          callbacks=[early_stop])
          
This will stop training once the validation loss stops improving for the number of epochs specified by patience.
